## Oldspeakful words
NewspeakSpeakwriter is the third generation programming language in the world. Approved by Ministry of Love (Miniluv) in 1984, NewspeakSpeakwriter has been widely used programming language, replacing C. All the computer programs in Oceania now run in NewspeakSpeakwriter. Miniluv plans to ban using C as a programming language since C potentially provokes a crimethink.
